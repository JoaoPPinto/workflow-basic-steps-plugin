<div>
    Runs its body repeatedly until it returns <code>true</code>.
    If it returns <code>false</code>, waits a while and tries again.
    (Subsequent failures will slow down the delay between attempts up to a maximum of 15 seconds.)
    There is no limit to the number of retries,
    but if the body throws an error that is thrown up immediately.
    The maximum wait time between attempt is 15 seconds (even if you set a recurrence period higher)
